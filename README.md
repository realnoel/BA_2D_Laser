# Enhancing Long-Horizon Predictions of Neural PDE Solvers Through Refinement-Based Rollout Strategies

This repository contains the code and dataset loaders used for the Bachelor thesis **"Enhancing Long-Horizon Predictions of Neural PDE Solvers Through Refinement-Based Rollout Strategies"** at ETH Zürich, Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering (MAVT).

The project explores **neural operator architectures** (Fourier Neural Operator, Convolutional Neural Operator, PDE-Refiner) for **data-driven modeling of thermal partial differential equations (PDEs)** in laser-based heat transfer.  
The models are trained on spatio-temporal temperature field data simulated on a 2-D metal plate, with **exogenous control variables** representing laser power input and spatial displacement fields.
